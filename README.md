## Description 

This project was done as part of a group project for the Course Big Data for Social Analysis at NCCU. 

We look at gender related aspects in donations to the presidential Candidate Committees of Donald Trump and Joe Biden in the 2020 Presidential Election. 
We put a focus on the share of donations as well as the share of donors which are women. 

For a detailed description of our results and methodology please have a look at our [Paper](https://github.com/svensglinz/Data_Analysis_Project/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20Project%20Paper.pdf)

## Data 

**Data which was used in this code and which should be part of the folder "files" but is too large to upload on github can be found under:** 
- https://1drv.ms/u/s!AoQRAZtdS9u4iO9TuONDuD-JNd3SYQ?e=2w5yAi

--> The files in the donations folder are the result of a split of the original text file that was downloaded from the Federal Election Comissions Bulk Download Service (>16GB). We split the file into smaller text files with 1 Mio lines each with the git bash command split *donations.txt -l 1000000*
